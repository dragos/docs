Roadmap
=======

4.0.0 - codename Lithium
------------------------

The following is a rough list of work items, in the order we expect to be working on them. There may be changes of plans, and other things are prioritized, but we will try to keep this list up to date.

We welcome your help in any of the following areas (follow the usual approach, and start a discussion on scala-ide-dev to check nobody is currently working on your feature)

Milestone 1
~~~~~~~~~~~

ScalaDoc integration. As soon as PR 481 is merged, we plan to release M1. Most UI work is still to be done, and we'd appreciate community contributions in these areas:

- prettify hovers and HTML rendering for code, paramters, use-cases
- integrate javadocs
- work with associated docs

Milestone 2
~~~~~~~~~~~
